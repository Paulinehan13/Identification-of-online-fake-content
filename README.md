# Extra Pipepline for Reference
<!-- Program pipeline
1.	Users input a claim like “Obama is not a US citizen”
2.	Our program will search Event Registry’s database for thousands of articles related to the keywords.
3.	We run those articles through our home-grown stance detection machine learning model which will determine each article’s relevance to the claim and it’s stance on it. We determine if an article agrees/disagrees/is-neutral or is unrelated to the input claim.
4.	We then access our ever-evolving database of source reputability. If lots of reputable sources all agree with your claim, then it’s probably true!
5.	Then we cite our sources so our users can click through and read more about that topic!
